# Dungeon-Mapper
**Roll20 API:** Auto Dynamic Lighting that Moves with the Tiles, Texture Pack approach, User Interface and Door/Torch Controls.

**The idea is:**
* Leverage the new hyperlink API chat buttons (using an image of the tile as a preview.)
* Leverage the "object.remove()" so dynamic lighting can move with the tiles.
* Present a basic approach to "texture packs" for tiles (so you can switch out tiles as you build the map.)

**Steps to install/use:**

1. Add the "DungeonMapper" script.
2. Add the "DungeonMapperTextures".
3. Add the "DungeonMapperDoors".
4. Enter the command "!DungeonMapper."
5. Place a "check" in the "in bar" option for the macro named "â™¦1-Dungeon-Mapper."
6. Click that macro once it shows up and use the chat pane user interface.
7. Click it any time in the future to bring up the chat pane user interface.

**Note:** Script edits the map with the "player bookmark."
